# BL4IR-TH3-W124RD (DISCONTINUED AS OF 2023)
### My "Flagship" Discord bot!

## Foreword:
The project is no longer being updated anymore due to personal reasons and personal preference.
This doesn't mean I won't stop creating bots. I will launch a new bot with a new sourcecode when ``Discord.js`` V15 comes out or when
I'm no longer busy in school. The sourcecode will always ``100%`` be free and never will be locked behind a paywall, free for
everyone. ~~SPOILERS: The bot's name will probably be Hyperion or Paladin, idk.~~

Until next time,

ArchangelTheGod
